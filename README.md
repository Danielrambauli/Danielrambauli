# 👋 Hi, I'm Daniel Rambauli

🎓 I'm a dedicated third-year Information Technology student with a strong foundation in software development and a passion for solving real-world problems through code. I specialize in both front-end and back-end development, with experience in Java, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, PHP, and a growing proficiency in Python.

💡 I enjoy building projects that are not only technically sound but also meaningful, user-focused, and scalable. I'm always exploring new technologies and frameworks to stay up to date with industry standards.

🚀 **Current Projects:**
- 📍 Building a real-time **JavaScript Collaborative Code Editor** designed to help students **navigate campus** and **connect with peers nearby** — combining location-based services with real-time interaction.
- ✅ Developing a **Python-based Task Management System** using Django, focused on helping small teams efficiently manage projects, deadlines, and collaboration.

🔍 **What I Bring:**
- A strong problem-solving mindset  
- Eagerness to learn and grow in fast-paced environments  
- Solid understanding of OOP, web technologies, and version control (Git/GitHub)  
- Excellent communication and teamwork skills

📈 I'm actively building a portfolio that reflects my capabilities as a future-ready developer. I'm excited about opportunities where I can contribute, learn, and make an impact.

📫 **Let’s connect!**  
Feel free to explore my repositories or reach out for collaboration or internship opportunities.
