## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a third-year Information Technology diploma student with a strong passion for software development and continuous learning. I have practical experience in Java, JavaScript, HTML & CSS, and PHP, and I'm currently expanding my skills in Python. I enjoy building real-world projects that combine both front-end and back-end development. I'm focused on growing as a full-stack developer and look forward to contributing to impactful and innovative tech solutions.
